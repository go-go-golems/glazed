# Log 2022-12-04

Today I'm continuing to work on getting the output of the help command to look great, 
and make it possible to query examples and tutorials.

The idea is to make the output of help look something like this (See [RFC 7 - Help system](../rfcs/drafts/07_2022-12-03_help-system.md)):

```
glaze is a tool to format structured data

Usage:
  glaze help [topic|command] [flags]
  
Available Topics:
  templates   Using go templates for formatted output
  ...         ...
  
Help Commands:
  toc         Show table of contents for all help sections
  tags        List all documentation tags
  search      Search for string in documentation
  serve       Run local webserver with browsable version of the documentation
  
glaze Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command or topic
  json        Format JSON data
  yaml        Format YAML data
  
Flags:
  --examples       Show examples for command or topic
  --tutorials      Show tutorials for command or topic
  --applications   Show real-world use cases (can require additional tools)
  --tags strings   Show only sections matching relevant tags (supports simple * glob)
  --flags strings  Show only sections matching the given flags (supports simple * glob)
  
  
Examples:

  # Show the table of contents 
  glaze help toc
  
  # Show examples for using templates
  glaze help templates --examples
  
  # Show all tutorials
  glaze help toc --tutorials
  
  # Show real world applications of the json command using the --template flag
  glaze help json --applications --flags *template*
```

## Extracting the help templates to their own files

The syntax highlighting of template strings is not available in goland, which seems a bit weird.
Couldn't find a ticket for it either, so for now I'm splitting the templates out.

If we look at the structure of our current template, we can extract the following structure used by cobra
(and provided by cobra.Command):

- Command
  - Runnable
    - UseLine
  - HasAvailableSubCommands
    - CommandPath
    - Commands
    - len(Groups) == 0  -- This is the "Available Commands" section
      - foreach Commands
        - IsAvailableCommand
        - Name
        - NamePadding
        - Short
      - foreach Groups = $group
        - $group.Title
        - foreach Commands
          - GroupID
          - $group.ID
          - IsAvailableCommand
          - Name
          - NamePadding
          - Short
  - Aliases
    - NameAndAliases
  - HasExample
    - Example
  - HasAvailableLocalFlags
    - .LocalFlags.FlagUsages
  - HasAvailableInheritedFlags
    - .InheritedFlags.FlagUsages
  - HasHelpSubCommands -- this is "Additional help topics"
    - foreach .Commands
      - IsAdditionalHelpTopicCommand
        - CommandPath
        - CommandPathPadding
        - Short
  - HasAvailableSubCommands
    - CommandPath

So what we want to do here is intersperse some additional sections in there:

- HelpTopics
- HelpCommands
- HelpFlags
- Examples
- Tutorials
- Applications

Some of those will apply to all commands, for example if we take the `glaze json` command, this could look like:

``` 
Format JSON data

Usage:
  glaze json [flags]

Flags:
  -o, --output string            Output format (table, csv, tsv, json, yaml, sqlite) (default "table")
  -f, --output-file string       Output file
      --table-format string      Table format (ascii, markdown, html, csv, tsv) (default "ascii")
      --with-headers             Include headers in output (CSV, TSV) (default true)
      --csv-separator string     CSV separator (default ",")
      --output-as-objects        Output as individual objects instead of JSON array
      --flatten                  Flatten nested fields (after templating)
      --template string          Go Template to use for single string
      --template-field strings   For table output, fieldName:template to create new fields, or @fileName to read field templates from a yaml dictionary
      --use-row-templates        Use row templates instead of column templates
      --fields string            Fields to include in the output, default: all
      --filter string            Fields to remove from output
      --sort-columns             Sort columns alphabetically (default true)
      --input-is-array           Input is an array of objects
  -h, --help                     help for json
```

I realize it would be nice to be able to group the flags in group as well, maybe that is possible already?
It's a bit unclear from the usage template how the flag usages are rendered. It's using the `.LocalFlags.FlagUsages`
lookup.

This actually corresponds to

```go
package cobra

// FlagUsages returns a string containing the usage information for all flags in
// the FlagSet
func (f *FlagSet) FlagUsages() string {
  return f.FlagUsagesWrapped(0)
}

// FlagUsagesWrapped returns a string containing the usage information
// for all flags in the FlagSet. Wrapped to `cols` columns (0 for no
// wrapping)
func (f *FlagSet) FlagUsagesWrapped(cols int) string {
  buf := new(bytes.Buffer)

  lines := make([]string, 0, len(f.formal))

  maxlen := 0
  f.VisitAll(func(flag *Flag) {
    if flag.Hidden {
      return
    }

    line := ""
    if flag.Shorthand != "" && flag.ShorthandDeprecated == "" {
      line = fmt.Sprintf("  -%s, --%s", flag.Shorthand, flag.Name)
    } else {
      line = fmt.Sprintf("      --%s", flag.Name)
    }

    varname, usage := UnquoteUsage(flag)
    if varname != "" {
      line += " " + varname
    }
    if flag.NoOptDefVal != "" {
      switch flag.Value.Type() {
      case "string":
        line += fmt.Sprintf("[=\"%s\"]", flag.NoOptDefVal)
      case "bool":
        if flag.NoOptDefVal != "true" {
          line += fmt.Sprintf("[=%s]", flag.NoOptDefVal)
        }
      case "count":
        if flag.NoOptDefVal != "+1" {
          line += fmt.Sprintf("[=%s]", flag.NoOptDefVal)
        }
      default:
        line += fmt.Sprintf("[=%s]", flag.NoOptDefVal)
      }
    }

    // This special character will be replaced with spacing once the
    // correct alignment is calculated
    line += "\x00"
    if len(line) > maxlen {
      maxlen = len(line)
    }

    line += usage
    if !flag.defaultIsZeroValue() {
      if flag.Value.Type() == "string" {
        line += fmt.Sprintf(" (default %q)", flag.DefValue)
      } else {
        line += fmt.Sprintf(" (default %s)", flag.DefValue)
      }
    }
    if len(flag.Deprecated) != 0 {
      line += fmt.Sprintf(" (DEPRECATED: %s)", flag.Deprecated)
    }

    lines = append(lines, line)
  })

  for _, line := range lines {
    sidx := strings.Index(line, "\x00")
    spacing := strings.Repeat(" ", maxlen-sidx)
    // maxlen + 2 comes from + 1 for the \x00 and + 1 for the (deliberate) off-by-one in maxlen-sidx
    fmt.Fprintln(buf, line[:sidx], spacing, wrap(maxlen+2, cols, line[sidx+1:]))
  }

  return buf.String()
}

```

So we can see that it actually doesn't use a template here at all. It also doesn't seem to have the option to separate
flags per group, which is something we could do. So, if we provide our own parallel way of registering flags for help
system purposes, per command, then we start doing some funky formatting.

``` 
Format JSON data

Usage:
  glaze json [flags]
  
The `json` command allows for the processing of input JSON data. 
This data can be output as either objects, or as a table. 
The command gives you control over how fields are mapped to columns,
how they are formatted, and provides the general set of glaze transformation
middlewares.
  
General Flags:
  -h, --help                     help for json
  
Input Flags:
  --input-is-array           Input is an array of objects

Output Flags:
  -o, --output string            Output format (table, csv, tsv, json, yaml, sqlite) (default "table")
  -f, --output-file string       Output file
  
Table Formatting Flags:
  --table-format string      Table format (ascii, markdown, html, csv, tsv) (default "ascii")
  --with-headers             Include headers in output (CSV, TSV) (default true)
  --csv-separator string     CSV separator (default ",")
      
Object Output Flags:
  --output-as-objects        Output as individual objects instead of JSON array
  --flatten                  Flatten nested fields (after templating)
      
Templating:
  Glaze allows for templated output. For additional information, see
      glaze help templates 
  
  Templating flags:
      --template string          Go Template to use for single string
      --template-field strings   For table output, fieldName:template to create new fields, or @fileName to read field templates from a yaml dictionary
      --use-row-templates        Use row templates instead of column templates
      
Filtering And Sorting:
      --fields string            Fields to include in the output, default: all
      --filter string            Fields to remove from output
      --sort-columns             Sort columns alphabetically (default true)

Examples:
  Output JSON as human-readable table:
    glaze json foo.json
  
  For more examples, run:
    glaze help json --examples
    
  To get examples that contain a specific flag:
    glaze help json --examples --flag fields
  
  To get examples related to a specific topic:
    glaze help json --topic table-formatting --examples
   
Applications:
  Convert a datadog dump into a csv and store in s3:
    glaze help json --application datadog
    
  Convert CSV into a list of templated files:
    glaze help json --application csv-templates

  For a complete overview of all applications, run:
    glaze help json --applications
    
Tutorials:

  Learn how to convert json objects into aggregated templates:
    glaze help json --tutorial convert-json
    glaze help json --tutorials
```

Now that might be a bit too much for the first go at it.

Maybe once we have a bit more experience in providing things as groups we can then focus on grouping flags as well.

So I'm pretty sure we don't need a hierarchy of help sections, and instead might need a type field.
What I see here is:

- toplevel documentation topics that can be keyed to certain commands. For example, the templates topic.
  - this could be a section with the tags:
    - toplevel
    - command:json
    - flag:template
    - flag:template-field
    - topic:templates
  - the slug could be templates, or do we actually want to keep this as a tag as well?
    - maybe we can actually separate out the semantically meaningful tags, no reason to hack it in with the "foobar:bla"
syntax.
  - each section needs a Title that can be used when it's only listed on a single line
  - each section could have a short description when listed as part of a command help, for example
- we can fix the order in which the topics are shown
  - flags, then documentation topics, then examples, then applications, then tutorials
  - this mirrors the structure used in mathematica where the first section is a toplevel API
- in terms of section types, we have:
  - general help topics (for examples templates)
  - examples
  - applications
  - tutorials
  - additional ideas:
    - long form description of flags? (but that can be first modelled as a general help topic)

Looking at the above structure, we can achieve that without having to actively mess with the command template 
data (since we don't need to mess with the individual flags for now)

## Architecture of the help system

We need something a bit more complex than just a list of sections that we can query.
I think we can organize things by a system of pages (a page for a specific command or topic for example),
and then allow for a series of queries (using a query language at some point, but for now I think we can bruteforce
things by writing them all out explicitly as full methods, with long names to make their goal clear).

These queries could be, inferred from the examples above:

- get the page for a command
  - this contains all the general topics that reference that command in their Commands array
  - this contains all the examples that reference that command
  - this contains all the applications that reference that command
  - this contains all the tutorial that reference that command
  - that query would be `GetSectionsForTypeAndCommand()`
- Get the list of sections that match a specific flag (for the query glaze help json --flag template)
- get the list of topics for a command (so they can be listed as suggestions)
  - this can really just be run on a list of sections

There are two ways to render the results of these queries:
- one is the "short" form when it is embedded in the context of a bigger page
  - here, we only show the short description and potentially elide the things that are not set to be shown by default
  - if some topics have been elided, we need to show the command to get the full list (the toc representation)
- one is the "full" form, where additional queries are then shown at the bottom (for example for related topics, etc)
- one is the "toc" form
  - this is similar to the short form, but is more restricted in its query (usually), and we don't elide topics

Alright, I think that might be enough.

Let's design the structure to be passed to the template, and the templates themselves.

## First try

Alright, that was a pretty good looking first try, this is what I get with my test data:

```
❯ go run ./cmd/glaze help json

  -o, --output string            Output format (table, csv, tsv, json, yaml, sqlite) (default "table")

      --table-format string      Table format (ascii, markdown, html, csv, tsv) (default "ascii")
      --with-headers             Include headers in output (CSV, TSV) (default true)
      --csv-separator string     CSV separator (default ",")
      --output-as-objects        Output as individual objects instead of JSON array
      --flatten                  Flatten nested fields (after templating)

      --filter string            Fields to remove from output
      --sort-columns             Sort columns alphabetically (default true)
      --input-is-array           Input is an array of objects
  -h, --help                     help for json

```

But, it's really hard to visually parse, and the way to set it up in main.go is really quite annoying.

I think it's time to both use the glamour renderer, and read the help and examples from files.

In fact, to render out the output of the command line examples, that could really be its own little tool,
because it's useful in a lot of context. It takes a structured definition of the command line description,
and it provides the option to render out a run, it can also create a demo vhs tape from a collection of commands,
it can also render out some nice documentation (along with the runs), and it can also unit test the output 
and even show diffs.

I wonder what that tool could be called, and if I want to yakshave on it today. It would actually make rendering the
documentation for glazed easier.

What about "cliopatra", that's pretty funny.

## Adding markdown output

The first problem I ran into is that of course the cobra template is actually not markdown,
so for example the rendering of the flags was all munched up. Furthermore, it looks like glamour per default sets the 
wordwrap to 80, and this leads to some ugly display for the longer  flag options.

This means I should detect the terminal width to set the proper rewrap for the markdown output, and in the
process of doing so found the reflow library:
- https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/issues/43
- https://github.com/muesli/reflow

## More notes

looks like cobra actually already has functionality to provide examples, which we maybe are going to shortcircuit?

There's ways to customize the glamour output withstyles, but I'm not sure how easy it is to tweak
programmatically / load my own without recompiling charm. Here's the documentation:
- https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour#styles
- https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour/tree/master/styles/gallery
- https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour/tree/master/styles

Also saw that there is a notty style for glamour that has no colors, which wemight consider using.

## Parsing help from markdown files

glamour uses the https://github.com/yuin/goldmark library. And this would allow us to parse YAML metadata:
- https://github.com/yuin/goldmark-meta  
I'm actually not sure if we really need to parse the body at all, but that might be interest in case we want to parse 
applications and similar things out later on .

## Error handling with help

We have a problem when there is an error parsing strings or the like. 
cobra calls UsageString() which seems to render the whole thing without colors, 
which is a bit annoying. We could potentially catch that by forcing the style to be colorful
if we realize before executing the command that we are running in a real terminal, 
and only setting it to notty if things are really piped.

This lack of introspection into if we are called from error status or from help status
is a bit weird. Maybe we can fake that with some flags.

Got it to work, it was stupidity on my part. However, 
we need a way to properly handle color output both in help and
when the output is redirected. It feels that this should be handled at a global level.


## Starting to split out the README documentation

I'm starting to move out the examples from the README to individual markdown files
in the cmds/glaze/doc directory, but of course I still want to use those in the main
README that will be visible on github so that everything is apparent at once.

I think it would be good to render this using markdown, maybe this can even be done
with glaze itself since it has the `docs` command? Although something a bit more custom will
probably be necessary, or the addition of special template functions to make it possible.

In fact, why not try? We could register additional functions to the template renderer, which I 
don't think is possible right now.

But first let's actually convert all the documentation to have a good starting point,
and fix rendering the actual topic rendering.
