### Review of `glazed/pkg/doc/topics/10-template-command.md`

#### 1. Overall Assessment

The document provides a solid and functional overview of the `TemplateCommand`. It successfully explains what the command is, how to define it in YAML, and how it can be used. The structure is logical, and it correctly uses the `glaze help` format for internal links.

The main areas for improvement lie in adhering more closely to the principles of conciseness in code examples and ensuring that every section has the required topic-focused introduction.

#### 2. Compliance with Documentation Guidelines

Here is a checklist of how the document fares against the `how-to-write-good-documentation-pages.md` guide:

-   [x] **Clarity & Conciseness**: Mostly clear, but the main Go example is too verbose.
-   [x] **Accuracy**: Assumed to be accurate.
-   [x] **Audience-Centric**: Generally good.
-   [x] **YAML Front Matter**: Correctly implemented.
-   [x] **H1 Title Matches**: Correct.
-   [ ] **Section Introductions**: **Missing** for "Parameter Types" and "Integration with Command Loaders".
-   [ ] **Minimal Code Examples**: The main Go example is **too complex** and not focused on a single concept.
-   [x] **Internal Linking Style**: Correctly uses `glaze help`.

#### 3. Specific Recommendations

##### 3.1. Add Missing Introductory Paragraphs

Two sections are missing their topic-focused introductions. They should be added to provide context before presenting the content.

-   **For `## Parameter Types`:**
    > **Suggested Addition:** Template commands can leverage the full range of Glazed parameter types, allowing for rich and validated inputs. This means you can create templates that accept everything from simple strings and booleans to lists, choices, and even content from files.

-   **For `## Integration with Command Loaders`:**
    > **Suggested Addition:** While `TemplateCommand` can be loaded manually, its real power is unlocked when used with the command loader system. This allows you to build applications that discover and load commands from a directory of YAML files, enabling you to add new functionality without recompiling your application.

##### 3.2. Simplify the Go Code Example

The example under `## Loading and Running Template Commands` is too long and detailed for a reference document. It shows the low-level mechanics of creating a `ParsedLayer`, which, while technically correct, is more appropriate for a dedicated tutorial on programmatic command execution.

The example should be simplified to focus *only* on the loading mechanism and a high-level view of execution.

**Current Example (Too Complex):**

```go
// ... (full main function) ...

func runTemplateCommand(cmd *cmds.TemplateCommand, values map[string]interface{}) {
	// Get default parameter layer
	defaultLayer, ok := cmd.Description().Layers.Get(layers.DefaultSlug)
	if !ok {
		panic("default layer not found")
	}
	
	// Create parsed layer with parameter values
	var options []layers.ParsedLayerOption
	for k, v := range values {
		// ... (manual creation of ParsedLayerOption) ...
	}
	
	parsedLayer, err := layers.NewParsedLayer(defaultLayer, options...)
	// ... (manual creation of ParsedLayers) ...
	
	// Execute template
	var output strings.Builder
	err = cmd.RunIntoWriter(context.Background(), parsedLayers, &output)
    // ...
}
```

**Recommended Revision (Minimal and Focused):**

This revised version focuses on the loader and points to the `runner` package for execution, which is the more common and higher-level approach.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"github.com/go-go-golems/glazed/pkg/cmds"
	"github.com/go-go-golems/glazed/pkg/cmds/runner"
)

func main() {
	yamlContent := `name: greeting
short: A simple greeting command
flags:
  - name: name
    type: string
    default: "World"
template: "Hello, {{.name}}!"`

	// 1. Load the command from a YAML string
	loader := &cmds.TemplateCommandLoader{}
	commands, err := loader.LoadCommandFromYAML(strings.NewReader(yamlContent))
	if err != nil || len(commands) == 0 {
		panic(err)
	}
	
	cmd := commands[0]

	// 2. Run the command programmatically
	// The runner handles parsing and execution.
	// For more complex execution, see `glaze help programmatic-execution`.
	err = runner.RunCommand(
		context.Background(),
		cmd,
		// Provide parameter values for the "default" layer
		runner.WithValues(map[string]interface{}{
			"name": "Alice",
		}),
		// Direct output to stdout
		runner.WithWriter(os.Stdout),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Expected output: Hello, Alice!
}
```

This revised example is better because it:
-   Is shorter and easier to understand at a glance.
-   Demonstrates a more common and higher-level API (`runner.RunCommand`).
-   Focuses on the key concepts: loading from YAML and then running the result.
-   Removes the complex, low-level details of manually constructing `ParsedLayer` objects.

#### 4. Conclusion

The document is a great start. By adding the missing introductory paragraphs and simplifying the complex Go example, it will fully align with the documentation guidelines and become a much more effective reference for developers.
