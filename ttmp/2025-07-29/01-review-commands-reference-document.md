# Review of `glazed/pkg/doc/topics/commands-reference.md`

## 1. Overall Assessment

This document is an exceptionally thorough and well-written guide to the Glazed command system. It covers everything from basic concepts to advanced patterns. However, its length and level of detail blur the line between a concise *reference* and an in-depth *tutorial*.

The primary goal of this review is to suggest changes that would sharpen its focus as a reference document, making it easier for developers to quickly look up interfaces, parameter types, and core patterns. More verbose, step-by-step examples can be split into separate, dedicated tutorial documents.

## 2. Major Suggestions for Splitting Content

### 2.1. Move "Complete Implementation Example" to a Tutorial

The section **"Complete Implementation Example"** (lines 486-583) is a self-contained tutorial on how to build a Glaze command from scratch. It's an excellent resource for beginners but is too verbose for a reference guide.

**Recommendation:**
- **Create a new tutorial file**: For example, `glazed/pkg/doc/tutorials/05-creating-a-glaze-command.md`.
- **Move the entire section**: Cut the content from the reference doc and paste it into the new tutorial.
- **Add a link**: Replace the section in `commands-reference.md` with a concise paragraph and a link:
  > For a complete, step-by-step guide to building a `GlazeCommand` from scratch, see the [Creating a Glaze Command Tutorial](../tutorials/05-creating-a-glaze-command.md).

This change alone would significantly shorten the document and remove redundancy, as many concepts from the example are already explained in preceding sections.

### 2.2. Move "Dynamic Command Generation" to an Advanced Guide

The **"Dynamic Command Generation"** section (lines 962-1011) covers a powerful but highly specialized pattern. It is not a common use case for most developers and adds considerable length to the document.

**Recommendation:**
- **Create a new guide**: For example, `glazed/pkg/doc/topics/advanced-command-generation.md`.
- **Move the section**: Relocate the content to this new guide.
- **Link from "Advanced Patterns"**: Add a bullet point under "Advanced Patterns" that links to this new document for users interested in the topic.

## 3. Minor Suggestions for Condensing Examples

The examples for the core command interfaces (`BareCommand`, `WriterCommand`, `GlazeCommand`) are well-written but could be more focused. They contain business logic that, while realistic, distracts from the core pattern being demonstrated.

**Recommendation:**
- **Shorten `BareCommand` Example (`CleanupCommand`)**: The example can be reduced to its essential form, focusing on the `Run` method and `InitializeStruct` pattern without the detailed file-finding and removal logic. A "pseudocode" style would be effective here.

  *Before:*
  ```go
  // ... full implementation with file scanning and removal ...
  ```

  *After:*
  ```go
  // ... (struct definition) ...
  func (c *CleanupCommand) Run(ctx context.Context, parsedLayers *layers.ParsedLayers) error {
      s := &CleanupSettings{}
      if err := parsedLayers.InitializeStruct(layers.DefaultSlug, s); err != nil {
          return err
      }
      
      fmt.Printf("Starting cleanup in %s (dry run: %v)\n", s.Directory, s.DryRun)
      
      // --- Business logic for finding and removing files would go here ---
      
      fmt.Println("Cleanup process finished.")
      return nil
  }
  ```

- **Shorten `WriterCommand` Example (`HealthReportCommand`)**: Similarly, the health report logic can be simplified to just a few `fmt.Fprintf` calls to demonstrate writing to the `io.Writer`.

- **Shorten `GlazeCommand` Example (`MonitorServersCommand`)**: The core of this example is creating `types.NewRow` and passing it to the `gp.AddRow`. The example can be trimmed to show just one or two server checks, rather than looping. The variety of data types (strings, numbers, nested objects) should be preserved but in a more compact form.

## 4. Content to Keep

The following sections are essential for a reference document and should be kept as they are:

- **Architecture of Glazed Commands**: The diagram is very helpful.
- **Core Packages**: Essential for navigation.
- **Command Interfaces**: The definitions and use cases are critical.
- **Parameters section**: The entire section (Type System, Definition Options, Arguments) is pure reference material and is excellent.
- **Command Building and Registration**: The Cobra integration details are vital.
- **Running Commands**: Programmatic execution is an important topic.
- **Structured Data Output (GlazeCommand)**: The "Creating Rows" section is fundamental.
- **Best Practices**: This section provides high-value, concise advice.
- **Next Steps**: Essential for guiding the reader.

## 5. Proposed New Document Outline

After applying these changes, the `commands-reference.md` would have a clearer, more reference-oriented structure:

1.  **Overview**
2.  **Architecture of Glazed Commands**
3.  **Core Packages**
4.  **Command Interfaces**
    - `BareCommand` (with a concise example)
    - `WriterCommand` (with a concise example)
    - `GlazeCommand` (with a concise example)
    - `Dual Commands`
5.  **Command Implementation**
    - Command Structure
    - Settings Structs and `InitializeStruct` Pattern
    - Working with Multiple Layers
    - *Link to the full tutorial for a complete example*
    - Common `InitializeStruct` Patterns
6.  **Parameters**
    - Parameter Type System (Basic, Collection, Choice, File, Special)
    - Parameter Definition Options
    - Working with Arguments
7.  **Command Building and Registration** (Cobra Integration)
8.  **Running Commands** (Programmatic Execution)
9.  **Structured Data Output (GlazeCommand)**
10. **Advanced Patterns**
    - Conditional Interface Implementation
    - Command Composition
    - *Link to the advanced guide on dynamic generation*
11. **Error Handling Patterns**
12. **Performance Considerations**
