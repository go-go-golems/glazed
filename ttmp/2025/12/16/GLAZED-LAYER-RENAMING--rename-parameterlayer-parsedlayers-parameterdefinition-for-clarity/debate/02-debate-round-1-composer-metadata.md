# Debate Round 1 Metadata - Created by Composer-1

## Document Information

**Created By:** composer-1 (AI Assistant)  
**Creation Date:** 2025-12-17T08:45:00-05:00  
**Purpose:** Independent analysis and debate round creation

## Related Document

The main debate round document is:
- `02-debate-round-1-independent-composer-analysis.md`

This document was created independently by composer-1 without reading the existing debate round (`01-debate-round-1-option-a-naming-api-design-schema-fields-values-sources.md`) to provide a fresh perspective.

## Methodology

The debate round was created following this process:

1. **Research Phase:**
   - Read key source files (`layer.go`, `parsed-layer.go`, `parameters.go`, `middlewares/layers.go`, `cli/cobra.go`)
   - Conducted codebase searches for usage patterns
   - Analyzed import patterns and API usage
   - Reviewed documentation and tutorials

2. **Evidence Gathering:**
   - Counted usage statistics (2,525 matches for ParameterLayer/ParsedLayer/ParameterDefinition)
   - Analyzed code structure and relationships
   - Examined CLI registration patterns
   - Reviewed middleware implementations

3. **Debate Construction:**
   - Created opening statements for each candidate persona
   - Grounded arguments in actual code evidence
   - Included rebuttals between candidates
   - Provided moderator summary with key findings

## Key Characteristics

- **Evidence-Based:** All arguments grounded in actual codebase analysis
- **Comprehensive:** Covers all candidate personas from debate prep document
- **Structured:** Follows debate framework format with research, statements, rebuttals, summary
