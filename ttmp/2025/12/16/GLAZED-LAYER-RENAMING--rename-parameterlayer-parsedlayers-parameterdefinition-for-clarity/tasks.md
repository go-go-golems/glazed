# Tasks

## TODO

- [ ] Inventory current public API surface (types, functions, packages) and downstream usage
- [ ] Pick a preferred naming bundle (A/B/C/D) and document rationale
- [ ] Draft a migration plan (aliases, deprecations, doc updates, timeline)
- [ ] Optional: prototype a tiny compatibility layer (new names re-export old)
