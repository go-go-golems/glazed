   - Content: Complete layers reference with examples, patterns, and best practices

2. **`pkg/doc/topics/commands-reference.md`** (NEW)
   - Merged from: `topics/15-using-commands.md` (enhanced with dual commands)
   - Type: GeneralTopic  
   - Content: Comprehensive command system reference including new dual command functionality

3. **`pkg/doc/tutorials/build-first-command.md`** (NEW)
   - Type: Tutorial
   - Content: Concise hands-on tutorial for building first Glazed command
   - Includes: Basic commands, dual commands, and practical examples

4. **`pkg/doc/tutorials/custom-layer.md`** (NEW)
   - Merged from: `custom-layer-tutorial.md` + logging layer examples
   - Type: Tutorial

   - Extracted from: `pkg/cmds/logging/README.md`
   - Type: Reference
   - Content: Pure API documentation for the Clay logging layer

### ✅ Updated Existing Files

1. **`pkg/doc/topics/21-cmds-middlewares.md`** → **`middlewares-guide.md`**
   - Updated slug from `glazed-middlewares` to `middlewares-guide`
   - Content largely intact, cross-links updated

2. **`pkg/doc/tutorials/03-commands-tutorial.md`** → **`advanced-commands-tutorial.md`**
   - Refocused on advanced topics (YAML commands, loaders)
   - Removed basic content (now in `build-first-command.md`)
   - Updated title and slug

3. **`pkg/doc/topics/15-using-commands.md`**
   - Enhanced with dual command documentation
   - Added comprehensive dual command examples
   - Updated architecture diagrams

### ✅ Removed Original Files

1. **`/doc/cmd-layers-guide.md`** - Removed (content merged into `layers-guide.md`)
2. **`pkg/cmds/layers/custom-layer-tutorial.md`** - Removed (content merged into `custom-layer.md`)
3. **`pkg/doc/topics/15-using-commands.md`** - Removed (content moved to `commands-reference.md`)
4. **`pkg/doc/tutorials/03-commands-tutorial.md`** - Removed (basic content moved to `build-first-command.md`)

### ✅ Streamlined Existing Files

1. **`pkg/cmds/logging/README.md`** - Reduced to pointer to new documentation locations

### ✅ Preserved Files

1. **`pkg/doc/applications/03-user-store-command.md`** - Kept as-is (application example)

## Target Structure Achieved

```
pkg/doc/
├── topics/
│   ├── layers-guide.md              ✅ NEW merged Layers reference
│   ├── commands-reference.md        ✅ NEW merged Commands reference  
│   └── middlewares-guide.md         ✅ (was 21-cmds-middlewares, updated)
├── tutorials/
│   ├── build-first-command.md       ✅ NEW concise hands-on tutorial
│   └── custom-layer.md              ✅ Merge of custom-layer-tutorial + logging
├── applications/
│   └── 03-user-store-command.md     ✅ Kept, may shrink (future task)
└── reference/
    └── logging-layer.md             ✅ Pure API doc extracted from README
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Topics**: Comprehensive reference materials
- **Tutorials**: Hands-on learning experiences  
- **Applications**: Complete example implementations
- **Reference**: Pure API documentation

### 2. **Eliminated Duplication**
- Consolidated scattered content into authoritative sources
- Removed redundant files and examples
- Single source of truth for each concept
- Streamlined existing files to avoid content overlap

### 3. **Better Discoverability**
- Logical progression: Tutorial → Topic → Reference
- Clear naming conventions
- Consistent cross-references

### 4. **Enhanced Content**
- Added dual command documentation throughout
- Comprehensive layer patterns and best practices
- Real-world examples and use cases
- Updated architecture diagrams

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Canonical files with proper front-matter
- Consistent structure and formatting
- Clear ownership and classification

## Documentation Flow

The new structure supports a clear learning progression:

1. **Start Here**: `build-first-command.md` - Get up and running quickly
2. **Learn Concepts**: `commands-reference.md` and `layers-guide.md` - Understand the system
3. **Advanced Techniques**: `custom-layer.md` and `middlewares-guide.md` - Build complex applications
4. **API Reference**: `logging-layer.md` - Detailed API documentation
5. **Examples**: `user-store-command.md` - See it all working together

## Cross-Reference Updates

All internal links have been updated to point to the new canonical locations:
- Tutorial references point to new tutorial files
- Topic cross-references updated
- Reference links maintained
- Application examples reference appropriate guides

## Impact on Users

### For New Users
- Clear starting point with `build-first-command.md`
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced
- Comprehensive examples and patterns

### For Existing Users  
- All existing content preserved in enhanced form
- Better organized and easier to find
- Enhanced with new dual command features

### For Contributors
- Clear place for each type of documentation
- Reduced maintenance burden through elimination of duplication
- Consistent structure for adding new content

This refactor successfully implements the consolidation plan while enhancing the documentation with new dual command functionality and maintaining all existing content in improved form.
